# dataDashboard
A place for code relating to the premier league data dashboard

The DataDashboard.html is the main website file, which I started using UIKit. To get it to work you'll have to download UIKit 3.0 to the folder you choose to run the website from (the stuff in the <head> of the document points to it). So far I've only added a navbar and the basic week's fixtures. Obviously we can play around with the order, or even completely redesign if necessary.
